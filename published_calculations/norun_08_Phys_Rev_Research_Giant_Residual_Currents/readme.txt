In the production of the data in our publication "Giant DC-like residual current generated by subcycle laser pulses", the definition of the electric field in fields.py is changed for the different data sets.

To reproduce the data, please use the files in /norun_08_Phys_Rev_Research_Giant_Residual_currents/cued/ for data from Fig. 2, 4, 6, 7, and the blue traces of Fig 5 and 8. For the red and orange traces of Fig. 5 and 8, use the code provided in the corresponding folders.
